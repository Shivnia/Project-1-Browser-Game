Project 1 Browser Game
===========

Description
---
Welcome to my first project! This project is a very simple quiz browser game that has a few categories in it. In the future I hope to add better design to the project since it is very bare bones and only really has designs on the buttons. Adding more information such as what question you are on and what your current score is are features I would also hope to add sometime too.

How to Install and Run the Project
---
The project can be started by opening up VScode, then run the command NPX serve . and starting the local host. Alternatively you can use the deploy link here to start it.

How to use the project
---
Once in the game select a category to begin, all questions are multiple choice. If an answer is correct the button will turn green, if it is wrong then the button will turn red and the correct answer will show. Once you are done with all of the questions you can either retry the quiz to aim for a better score or click the new category button to select a new category.
